# Data Science Udacity
## Project Motivation
Base on the CRISP-DM approach, the key for this notebook is to dig into the airbnb dataset and find out find out what element or matrixs effect the price of the listing accorss the two city, then maybe come out with some suggest for new host. We will dig into more detail by answer those 3 business question below:

- 1. Investiagte into highest and lowest price tag of listing in two city
- 2. what elements are most important for price
- 3. Find the correlation between price and customer_satification

## libraries used
The library used projetc are: pandas, time , skearn, matplotlib.

- pandas was use to clean and manage data
- time was use to calcuate amount of time use for the process to happen
- sklearn was use for modeling data and find key elements 
- matplotlib was use for final visualization purpose

## result for the project
For a quick conclusion, as we dig into data we find that the the top importance elements contribute to a higher price tag are : 'room_type','bedrooms','beds','accommodates' and 'cleaning_fee'. This is easy to understand, bigger long more beds higher the price and more cleaning_fee. Beside this we also find that the customer satisfaction actually do not relate to higer price.

As a suggest for new host: if your want to sale for place for higher price tag, then try well manage your place and make full use of the space(for example: try managing and make the place bigger to fill more room or bed, but at the same time make less sacrifice on the experience), because this is the quick way to rise your property's price tag.
